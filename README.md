Bootstrap Mobile Responsive HW assignment for week 2

In this project I created a mobile friendly (responsive) web page about myself using bootstrap.
I also made sure all semantics are correct and put in the proper areas.
Bootstrap components and grid system was what I worked with and I did use googles mobile friendly test to verify my site was good to go.
